Hello, we are Durudex team. We want to tell you everything about our project. Durudex is free social media, 
where users play a significant role.

# 🤔 How exactly users affect Durudex?

They can help us by taking a surveys such as:

## ⚖️ How the survey works?

To take part of the survey, the user must enter a certain amount of project coins into the voting account. 
The results of the poll will be known when there is 85% of the votes. At the end, everyone who took part of 
the survey get 70% back of the amount of coins that the user contributed. But where does the other 30% go? 
They go to developers account, who helped develop the project.

This is an account where developers can store their coins. At the end of each month, these coins will be 
distributed among all the developers on the list, and the list will be cleared. To get on this list you need 
to help the project with something. The more you help, the more reward you will receive.

# ‚ù§Ô∏è Help

You can help develop Durudex.

# üõ† How can I participate in the development?

If you a lot of cool ideas and you want to add or fix something, then you can take part in the development.
Yo can do this in several ways. If you know how to:

## Code

You need to create Fork from one of our Github repositories and you can create or change what you want.
At the end you need to do pull request to main repository. if the development team likes it 
then it will be accepted.
And if not then you will be told what is wrong so you can fix it.

## Create a design

Once you have completed your work, you need to write to us in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/4qcXbeVehZ).
You will be contacted by designers from the Durudex team, make sure they have the role of Durudex Team. They will review your
work, and decide what to do with it.
